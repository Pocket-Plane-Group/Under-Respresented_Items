      <p>First time installing a mod? Check out G3's comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player&rsquo;s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player&rsquo;s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the 
        patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one 
        that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the 
        mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Under-Represented Items for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. 
        When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-underrep.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> underrep</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-underrep.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-underrep.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>MacOS</strong><br />
        Under-Represented Items for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-underrep</strong>, <strong>setup-underrep.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> underrep</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-underrep.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-underrep.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Under-Represented Items for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>&lt; (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall underrep' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-underrep --uninstall at the command line to remove 
        all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <p>This mod adds items to Baldur's Gate II. The items come from Icewind Dale II. 
        Only certain kinds of items were chosen. Items were selected to flesh out 
        smaller weapon families. Here is a complete list of weapon types chosen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Two-Handed Axes</li>
        <li> Darts</li>
        <li> Halberds</li>
        <li> Short Swords</li>
        <li> Maces</li>
        <li> Hammers</li>
        <li> Spears</li>
        <li> Quarterstaves</li>
        <li> Daggers</li>
        <li> Bastard Swords</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where possible, both low-power and high-power items are added. This allows 
        characters to master these weapon types and remain competitive with 
        more traditional warriors.</p>
      <p>These items are accessible via a new merchant. Conlan (from IWD2's 
        Kuldahar) sells them in Ribald's Adventurer's Mart (AR0702) and outside the 
        Watcher's Keep (AR3000).</p>
      <p>This mod makes the game easier. It makes powerful items available. Without 
        it, a fighter specializing in maces has few weapon choices in most of the 
        game. With it, that fighter can use special effects or deal elemental 
        damage. Hopefully this will also make the game more fun. You may be 
        inspired to replay the game with non-standard (e.g., non-flail, non-katana, 
        non-two-handed-sword, non-longsword, non-sling) weapons.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>Why are many of these items +5?</p>
      <p><strong>A: </strong>In IWD2 high-plus items abound. </p>
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>Those prices are too high/low/sideways!</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> As above, please send me explicit percentile price changes. </p>
      <p><strong>Q: </strong>But do you have any role-playing suggestions?</p>
      <p><strong>A: </strong>Yes. Go download and install Kelsey. Have him and Anomen join your 
        party. Give Kelsey one of the new staves or darts. Give Anomen one of 
        the new maces. Listen to them talk. Recruit Valygar and have him 
        actually use a spear. Pick up Mazzy and make her a front-liner with a 
        short sword. Grab Korgan and have him use two-handed axes. Listen to 
        them talk. :-) Maybe your PC can branch out into halberds. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Name all of the weapons that can deal acid damage.</p>
      <p><strong>A: </strong>Acid Arrows, Flail of Ages, Frostreaver, Root of the Problem, 
        Blackblood. From Weimer Mods: Pitchwife, Sanchuudoku, Greataxe of 
        Digestion, Holy Hammer of Corrosive Burst, Miasmic Bastard Sword,

      <p>From Wes:</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Originally, the item were priced at 10% of their default IWD2 costs. IWD2 
          items often cost 250,000 gold. With an average charisma and reputation 
          these items tended to cost between 10,000 and 30,000 gold.</p>
        <p>However, this led to some items being quite cost effective (e.g. Lolth's 
          Cruel Sting, Rage of Chaos, Hammer of Lucerne) and others being way too 
          expensive (e.g., Infernal Halberd, Wrath, Vampiric Flame).</p>
        <p>New Theory. Let's imagine that you've got a 9th level fighter with 
          grand mastery, 3 attacks per round and 18/75 strength and 18 DEX. This is 
          reasonable for the early game. You're against a foe with AC -5, 50% fire 
          resistance (fire res is the most common in the game, and improved mages 
          will be completely immune to it), a saving throw of 5.  This enemy is 75% 
          likely to be evil and 25% like to be any other alignment :-).</p>
        <p>Your THAC0: 12 -2 (STR) -3 (GM) = 7<br />
          Your Bonus Damage: +3 (STR) +5 (GM) = +8</p>
        <p>With a standard +2 Long Sword you do this much damage in one round:<br />
          3 Attacks * (THAC0 7-2=5, AC -5 = 0.5) * (1d8+2+8 = 14.5) = 21.75</p>
        <p>Of course, &quot;expected damage&quot; isn't the best way to get a handle on things 
          (Celestial Fury's &quot;stun&quot; is hard to figure in, but it's _strong_), but it 
          will give us one clue. As an aside: Holy Smite (when cast by these weapons) 
          does 5d4 (save for half, blindness) which we'll approximate as: 3d4*.75 + 
          3d4*.75*.25 = 7 points of damage.</p>
        <p>Here are the expected damage values from the underrep weapons plus some 
          ==normal in-game items== (and their pre-markup [costs]):</p>

          Faeyr does five times as much damage as a mundane long sword in this 
          scenario.</p>
        <p><strong>General Commentary:</strong></p>
        <p> Sure Striking (+5) is basically worthless. You only ever really need +3 
          weapons (if you're going after Kangaxx you have your own special plans). 
          Disruption is also not very handy -- sure, you could perhaps take out a 
          vampire nest easily, but you can already do that with a 1000-gold scroll 
          of Undead Protection.</p>
        <p> It's also worth noting that the default BG2 prices (even for those things 
          meant to be purchased in stores) appear to have been assigned at random.</p>
        <p> Example:<br />
          Long Sword +1 &lt; Mace +1 &lt; Mace +2 &lt; Lilarcor +3 &lt; Long +2 &lt; Mace +3 &lt; Long +3</p>
        <p><strong>Specific Commentary:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li> Sulo's Hook -- this is clearly a +2 small shield that happens to be in 
            dagger form for our kensai or mage friends. If you could actually use a 
            shield you'd probably rather have Harmony, Reflection or Order. We'll 
            price this equal to the Fortress Shield. It provides less protection, 
            more saving throws... but unless you have stars in dual-wield it will 
            pull your main-hand thac0 down.</li>
          <li> Eye Gouger -- this should be the weapon of the gods (a dart with strength 
            bonuses and a high enchantment, plus remove magic)... except for that 
            bit where it blinds you for hours unless you make a save vs. poison, 
            making it basically useless (because once blinded the engine will walk 
            you into the middle of the melee where you will get pounded because of 
            the blindness penalties). So you can basically only use it if your 
            saves are all sub-zero, which happens loosely at the end of the game.</li>
          <li> Xvimian Fang -- if you have multiple attacks per round, the Emotion 
            casting will end up putting most of your enemies (from humans to 
            beholders, and not just the one you're attacking) to sleep. Thus it's 
            more expensive than its neighbors.</li>
          <li> Plague Darts -- about 10 plague darts can solo Captain Dennis and his 
            squad or Mencar and his gang or Tarnor's friends in the sewers -- 10 
            Insect Plagues are not to be sneezed at, especially since multiple 
            castings more or less guarantee panic in the enemies and no spells from 
            the spellcasters. Thus these things have to be expensive or they become 
            &quot;make money fast&quot; in the early game.</li>
          <li> Valorfoe -- the terror looks strong, but then you spend all of you time 
            running after some yellow-circled guy...</li>
          <li> Lolth -- since the web from this doesn't come from a spell, you can end 
            up paralyzing things that would normally be immune (e.g. liches, golems). 
            Free Action is also hard to come by.</li>
          <li> Rage of Chaos -- chaotic commands is strong and the chaos effect is very 
            strong (example use: confusing mages through their stoneskins) since 
            it doesn't come from a spell.</li>

        <p>For the most part I've tried to leave the readme intact since this is 
          ultimately Wes' mod. In v7 I made a first pass over item prices after 
          discussing it with folks in Discord, though I've externalized a price table 
          so players can adjust this with some quick tp2 and tpa editing. Otherwise it 
          was just some modernization, tracking down and fixing the stuff listed in 
          'known issues', some additional routine bug testing, and packaging it up and 
          making macOS and Linux versions.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Law, Auve, Thundax, and the rest of the Discord folks for feedback.</p>

      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Special thanks to Jason Compton, who continually encourages me to do more 
          one-day mods. This one took five hours. Looking back, I'm not sure why it 
          didn't take less. :-) Probably because I had to hand-convert the items from 
          IWD2 to BG2. Apparently I should have spent five more minutes making the 
          README readable. Next time I'll look into one of those NPCs, I guess.</p>
        <p>Special thanks also go out to Scarlet Tang and Gwen Morse, who probably 
          won't ever read this. We'll wave at Lisa Jonte as well :-).</p>

      <p><strong>Version 12 (CamDawg, September 22, 2022):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed the encoding of the Polish translation (thanks AL|EN!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 11 (CamDawg, September 19, 2022):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Further changes to prepare for EE Fixpack </li>
        <li>Corrected portrait icon for Greataxe of Ice +5 </li>
        <li>Massive Greataxe of Flame +5 was only adding 1d6 fire damage instead
          of the listed 2d6 </li>
        <li>Greataxe of Might +5 had an incorrect minimum STR </li>
        <li>Greataxe of Vampiric Flame was adding 2d6 fire damage instead of the 
          listed 1d6 </li>
        <li>Ranged weapons now use projectiles that better match projectiles used
          by other items, e.g. the throwing darts will use 1pp-style projectiles
          if available </li>
        <li>Infernal Halberd of the Defender was doing 2d10 fire damage instead of
          the listed 1d10 on 10% of hits </li>
        <li>Pudu's Fiery Blight was doing 1d10 fire damage instead of the listed 
          2d10 on 10% of hits </li>
        <li>Cornugon Hide Armor should not be usable by Avengers </li>
        <li>Caballus' Whispering Staff now uses the mace animation like other 
          one-handed staves </li>
        <li>Corrected weapon speeds for Life's Blood Drinker, Twelve Paces, 
          Lolth's Cruel Sting, Charged Short Sword of Wounding +5 </li>
        <li>Poison immunity could end up blocking the sound effects from Life's 
          Blood Drinker's HP drain on EE games </li>
        <li>Lolth's Cruel Sting would display the 'poisoned' icon even if the
          poison was blocked by magic resistance. Its Free Action will also
          block stun, if that option has been installed from the BG2 Fixpack </li>
        <li>The duration for the Chaos effect of Rage of Chaos was too long </li>
        <li>Corrected some miscellaneous file errors (e.g. leftover IWD2 flags).
          These shouldn't have affected gameplay, but are fixed anyway.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 10 (CamDawg, May 21, 2022):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated Russian translation </li>
        <li>A few minor adjustments to the immunity spellstate code for EE games </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 9 (CamDawg, May 18, 2022):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug with Delnar's Eye Gouger where its dispel-on-hit ability
          rarely worked. It now uses the same parameters as the dispel-on-hit
          abilities of Carsomyr or Staff of the Magi. (Credit to riklaunim
          for the bug report.) </li>
        <li>Certain item abilities now take advantage of EE-specific engine
          features, e.g. items which drain life will now use the new EE flags
          to do so in a more consistent and bug-free manner </li>
        <li>Rage of Chaos, which provides Chaotic Commands as an equipped effect,
          will now copy the effects of Chaotic Commands at install time, in
          case another mod has altered the spell </li>
        <li>In anticipation of the EE Fixpack, the items will use the various
          IMMUNITY spellstates to prevent effects that should be blocked, e.g.
          a creature immune to web may still get some effects (like sounds) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 8 (CamDawg, June 5, 2021):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added Polish translation, courtesy of Aristo from the Stars of Mystra
          translation team </li>
        <li>Added metadata for Project Infinity </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 7 (CamDawg, May 27, 2021):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated for the Enhanced Editions and EET </li>
        <li>Items which had an x% chance to do an effect were generally off by 1% </li>
        <li>Many weapons were too slow as weapon speed was not accounting for
          their enchantment bonuses </li>
        <li>Two-Handed axes now use a more axe-like mix of attacks rather than a
          halberd mix, e.g. more slashes and less thrusting attacks </li>
        <li>Some on-hit weapon effects, such as blindness from the Holy Greataxe
          of Justice, could incorrectly interact with spell protections due to
          incorrect power levels </li>
        <li>The poison damage of the Greataxe of Blurred Visions and the Life's
          Blood Drinker was doing 1 damage per second instead of the intended
          1 damage per round </li>
        <li>Added thieving penalties, correct usabilities and strength minimum to
          the Elven Chainmail of the Hand </li>
        <li>Various items were not providing combat feedback/visuals/portrait
          icons for their on-hit effects, e.g. the stun effect of Returning
          Stun Dart +1, the panic and confusion effects of the Monkey Paw of
          Discipline, etc. </li>
        <li>The &quot;undead destroyed&quot; message for disruption items was never
          displayed because of effect misordering </li>
        <li>The Cornugon Hide Armor was not properly restricting arcane
          spellcasting </li>
        <li>The Charged Short Sword of Wounding +5 was missing its poison damage </li>
        <li>The Mace of Goblin Slaying +1 was erroneously providing a save chance
          to its slay effect </li>
        <li>The new magical armors will now count against wearing multiple
          protection items. </li>
        <li>Conlan will now spawn correctly in ToB games. </li>
        <li>Items which provide an additional +2d6 damage against certain
          alignments now do the correct damage instead of the previous +1d6+6. </li>
        <li>Weapon descriptions were cleaned up; specifically they now list
          weapon speed and conform better to the existing weapon descriptions </li>
        <li>Conlan's dialogue was translated, but was always being compiled in
          English due to an old dialogue file </li>
        <li>The two darts that cast spells on their targets were causing a
          second, unnecessary projectile to move from the wielder to the target </li>
        <li>After some Discord feedback, tried to take up Wes' to-do of price
          adjustment. This has been externalized to a separate library so
          players can tweak these values to their own specs by some slight
          modification to the tp2 and library. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 6:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added Italian translation by Stoneangel. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 5:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rage Of Chaos now displays strings and animations when it
          confuses something. </li>
        <li>Staff of Greater Spell Resistance now correctly grants Magic
          Resistance instead of Magic Damage Resistance. </li>
        <li>Prices adjusted (see above). </li>
        <li>Cruel Sting free action bugfix, Rage chaotic commands bugfix. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 4:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mathrim Cauthon from the D'Oghmatiques has supplied a French
          translation. Thanks! </li>
        <li>Added Russian translation by SERKOS (Aerie.ru). </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 3:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Goblin Slaying mace usability and proficiency corrected. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 2:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>README translated from Gibberish to English. Thanks, Jason. </li>
        <li>&quot;+2d6 vs. X&quot; weapons now do &quot;+1d6+6&quot; instead of &quot;+4&quot;. Curse you,
          Infinity Engine, I'll not be defeated by you! </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1:</strong></p>
      <ul>
