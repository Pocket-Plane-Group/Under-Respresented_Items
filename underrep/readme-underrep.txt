    Section I. About ("simplified English") 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This mod adds items to Baldur's Gate 2. The items come from Icewind Dale 2.
Only certain kinds of items were chosen. Items were selected to flesh out
smaller weapon families. Here is a complete list of weapon types chosen: 

  Two-Handed Axes
  Darts
  Halberds
  Short Swords
  Maces
  Hammers
  Spears
  Quarterstaves
  Daggers
  Bastard Swords

Where possible, both low-power and high-power items are added. This allows
characters to master these weapon types and remain competitive with
more traditional warriors. 

These items are accessible via a new merchant. Conlan (from IWD2's
Kuldahar) sells them in Ribald's Adventurer's Mart (AR0702) and outside the
Watcher's Keep (AR3000).

This mod makes the game easier. It makes powerful items available. Without
it, a fighter specializing in maces has few weapon choices in most of the
game. With it, that fighter can use special effects or deal elemental
damage. Hopefully this will also make the game more fun. You may be 
inspired to replay the game with non-standard (e.g., non-flail, non-katana,
non-two-handed-sword, non-longsword, non-sling) weapons. 

See Section III for an item list.


    Section II. Installation
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII is required. ToB is optional but recommended.  This mod should work
fine with any WeiDU mod. See the webpage for details. 

As of version 7, the Enhanced Edition of the game is supported. The two
conversion projects--Baldur's Gate Trilogy and Enhanced Edition trilogy--
are also supported. 

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-Underrep.exe". 

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available: 

  American English 
  Francais (Mathrim Cauthon)
  Italian (Stoneangel) 
  Russian (SERKOS, Aerie.ru) 

You can have any color as long as it is black. 

There is only one component to install. You may always uninstall them 
later by re-running "Setup-Underrep.exe". 

You do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything you
installed. 

The components should install correctly for international players who have
both DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK.

    Section IV. Known Bugs
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am currently soliciting "price change" suggestions for these items. Let
me know how you think specific items should be adjusted.  Please quote
percentile increases or decreases, since the absolute price depends on your
reputation and charisma. Keep in mind that one goal is to make these items
available somewhat early. 

Note from CamDawg: v7 does make some pricing changes, and I'd like to continue 
to solicit pricing feedback. 


    Section V. Thanks
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special thanks to Jason Compton, who continually encourages me to do more
one-day mods. This one took five hours. Looking back, I'm not sure why it
didn't take less. :-) Probably because I had to hand-convert the items from
IWD2 to BG2. Apparently I should have spent five more minutes making the
README readable. Next time I'll look into one of those NPCs, I guess. 

Special thanks also go out to Scarlet Tang and Gwen Morse, who probably
won't ever read this. We'll wave at Lisa Jonte as well :-). 


    Section VI. FAQ
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: Why are many of these items +5?

A: In IWD2 high-plus items abound. 


Q: Those prices are too high/low/sideways!

A: As above, please send me explicit percentile price changes. 


Q: But do you have any role-playing suggestions? 

A: Yes. Go download and install Kelsey. Have him and Anomen join your
   party. Give Kelsey one of the new staves or darts. Give Anomen one of
   the new maces. Listen to them talk. Recruit Valygar and have him
   actually use a spear. Pick up Mazzy and make her a front-liner with a
   short sword. Grab Korgan and have him use two-handed axes. Listen to
   them talk. :-) Maybe your PC can branch out into halberds. 


Q: Name all of the weapons that can deal acid damage. 

A: Acid Arrows, Flail of Ages, Frostreaver, Root of the Problem,
   Blackblood. From Weimer Mods: Pitchwife, Sanchuudoku, Greataxe of
   Digestion, Holy Hammer of Corrosive Burst, Miasmic Bastard Sword, 
   Brutal Impact. 


    Section VII. Pricing
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Originally, the item were priced at 10% of their default IWD2 costs. IWD2
items often cost 250,000 gold. With an average charisma and reputation
these items tended to cost between 10,000 and 30,000 gold. 

However, this led to some items being quite cost effective (e.g. Lolth's
Cruel Sting, Rage of Chaos, Hammer of Lucerne) and others being way too
expensive (e.g., Infernal Halberd, Wrath, Vampiric Flame). 

New Theory. Let's imagine that you've got a 9th level fighter with
grand mastery, 3 attacks per round and 18/75 strength and 18 dex. This is
reasonable for the early game. You're against a foe with AC -5, 50% fire
resistance (fire res is the most common in the game, and improved mages
will be completely immune to it), a saving throw of 5.  This enemy is 75%
likely to be evil and 25% like to be any other alignment :-). 

Your THAC0: 12 -2 (STR) -3 (GM) = 7
Your Bonus Damage: +3 (STR) +5 (GM) = +8

With a standard +2 Long Sword you do this much damage in one round: 
  3 Attacks * (THAC0 7-2=5, AC -5 = 0.5) * (1d8+2+8 = 14.5) = 21.75

Of course, "expected damage" isn't the best way to get a handle on things
(Celestial Fury's "stun" is hard to figure in, but it's _strong_), but it
will give us one clue. As an aside: Holy Smite (when cast by these weapons)
does 5d4 (save for half, blindness) which we'll approximate as: 3d4*.75 +
3d4*.75*.25 = 7 points of damage. 

Here are the expected damage values from the underrep weapons plus some
==normal in-game items== (and their pre-markup [costs]): 

00.0 == Fortress Shield +3 (+7 vs. missiles) [9000] == 
12.1 Sulo's Hook (AC +3, +1 saves, 15% MDR) {9000}

27.3 == Lilarcor +3 (no charm, no confuse) [3000] == 
27.5 == Crimson Dart +3 [1250] == 
27.9 == Staff of Rynn +4 [13500] == 
28.9 == Frostreaver +3 [4700] ==

30.6 == Dragon's Breath Halberd +4 [6500] ==
31.6 Lolth (free act, 33% web) {9000}
31.9 Monkey Paw (15% panic, 5% confuse) {4800}
32.2 Phantom (reach) {4900}
36.9 == Fire Tooth Dagger +3 [5500] == 
38.0 Greater Spell (15% MR) {5000}
40.7 == Scarlet Ninja-To +3 [20000] == 
42.9 Blurred Visions (+3 AC, +1 saves) {18000}
42.9 Life's Blood (heal-2) {15000}

47.3 Slow and Steady {16000}
48.1 Halberd of Speed {16000}
48.3 Holy Greataxe of Justice (blind) {16000}
49.3 Might {16000}
50.2 Brutal Impact {17000}
50.4 Eye Gouger (90% remove magic, 5% blind you) {1000}
51.7 == Flail Of Ages +5 (free action, 5% mr, 33% slow) [9500] ==
52.2 Holy Hammer of Corrosive Bursts {17000}
52.8 Charged Short Sword {17000}
53.8 Digestion {18000}
53.8 Ice (50% cold res) {18000}
54.6 == Staff of the Ram +6 [8500] ==
54.7 Massive Greataxe of Flame {20000}
59.1 == Angurvadal +5 (no level drain) [9750] == 
61.2 == Throwing Impaler +4 [20000] ==
72.9 == Crom Faeyr +5 (trolls) [15500] == 
---- Plague Darts {8000}

The first thing to note is that weapons really do make a difference. Crom
Faeyr does five times as much damage as a mundane long sword in this
scenario. 

General Commentary: 
  Sure Striking (+5) is basically worthless. You only ever really need +3
  weapons (if you're going after Kangaxx you have your own special plans).
  Disruption is also not very handy -- sure, you could perhaps take out a
  vampire nest easily, but you can already do that with a 1000-gold scroll
  of Undead Protection. 

  It's also worth noting that the default BG2 prices (even for those things
  meant to be purchased in stores) appear to have been assigned at random.
  Example: 
  Long Sword +1 < Mace +1 < Mace +2 < Lilarcor +3 < Long +2 < Mace +3 < Long +3

Specific Commentary: 
  Sulo's Hook -- this is clearly a +2 small shield that happens to be in
    dagger form for our kensai or mage friends. If you could actually use a
    shield you'd probably rather have Harmony, Reflection or Order. We'll
    price this equal to the Fortress Shield. It provides less protection,
    more saving throws ... but unless you have stars in dual-wield it will
    pull your main-hand thac0 down. 
  Eye Gouger -- this should be the weapon of the gods (a dart with strength
    bonuses and a high enchantment, plus remove magic) ... except for that
    bit where it blinds you for hours unless you make a save vs. poison,
    making it basically useless (because once blinded the engine will walk
    you into the middle of the melee where you will get pounded because of
    the blindness penalties). So you can basically only use it if your
    saves are all sub-zero, which happens loosely at the end of the game. 
  Xvimian Fang -- if you have multiple attacks per round, the Emotion
    casting will end up putting most of your enemies (from humans to
    beholders, and not just the one you're attacking) to sleep. Thus it's
    more expensive than its neighbors. 
  Plague Darts -- about 10 plague darts can solo Captain Dennis and his
    squad or Mencar and his gang or Tarnor's friends in the sewers -- 10
    Insect Plagues are not to be sneezed at, especially since multiple
    castings more or less guarantee panic in the enemies and no spells from
    the spellcasters. Thus these things have to be expensive or they become
    "make money fast" in the early game. 
  Valorfoe -- the terror looks strong, but then you spend all of you time
    running after some yellow-circled guy ...
  Lolth -- since the web from this doesn't come from a spell, you can end
    up paralyzing things that would normally be immune (e.g. liches, golems). 
    Free Action is also hard to come by. 
  Rage of Chaos -- chaotic commands is strong and the chaos effect is very
    strong (example use: confusing mages through their stoneskins) since
    it doesn't come from a spell. 

    Section VIII. Notes from CamDawg
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
For the most part I've tried to leave the readme intact since this is 
ultimately Wes' mod. In v7 I made a first pass over item prices after 
discussing it with folks in Discord, though I've externalized a price table 
so players can adjust this with some quick tp2 and tpa editing. Otherwise it 
was just some modernization, tracking down and fixing the stuff listed in 
'known issues', some additional routine bug testing, and packaging it up and 
making OS X and Linux versions. 

Thanks to Law, Auve, Thundax, and the rest of the Discord folks for feedback. 

    Section IX. Changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1: 
        * Initial public release. 
Version 2: 
        * README translated from Gibberish to English. Thanks, Jason. 
        * "+2d6 vs. X" weapons now do "+1d6+6" instead of "+4". Curse you,
          Infinity Engine, I'll not be defeated by you!
Version 3: 
        * Goblin Slaying mace usability and proficiency corrected. 
Version 4: 
        * Mathrim Cauthon from the D'Oghmatiques has supplied a French
          translation. Thanks!
        * Added Russian translation by SERKOS (Aerie.ru).  
Version 5: 
        * Rage Of Chaos now displays strings and animations when it
          confuses something.
        * Staff of Greater Spell Resistance now correctly grants Magic
          Resistance instead of Magic Damage Resistance.
        * Prices adjusted (see above). 
        * Cruel Sting free action bugfix, Rage chaotic commands bugfix.
Version 6:
        * Added Italian translation by Stoneangel.
Version 7 (CamDawg, May 26, 2021):
        * Updated for the Enhanced Editions 
        * Items which had an x% chance to do an effect were generally off by 1%
        * Many weapons were too slow as weapon speed was not accounting for 
          their enchantment bonuses
        * Two-Handed axes now use a more axe-like mix of attacks rather than a 
          halberd mix, e.g. more slashes and less thrusting attacks
        * Some on-hit weapon effects, such as blindness from the Holy Greataxe 
          of Justice, could incorrectly interact with spell protections due to 
          incorrect power levels
        * The poison damage of the Greataxe of Blurred Visions and the Life's 
          Blood Drinker was doing 1 damage per second instead of the intended 
          1 damage per round
        * Added thieving penalties, correct usabilities and strength minimum to 
          the Elven Chainmail of the Hand
        * Various items were not providing combat feedback/visuals/portrait 
          icons for their on-hit effects, e.g. the stun effect of Returning 
          Stun Dart +1, the panic and confusion effects of the Monkey Paw of 
          Discipline, etc.
        * The "undead destroyed" message for disruption items was never 
          displayed because of effect misordering
        * The Cornugon Hide Armor was not properly restricting arcane 
          spellcasting
        * The Charged Short Sword of Wounding +5 was missing its poison damage
        * The Mace of Goblin Slaying +1 was erroneously providing a save chance 
          to its slay effect
        * The new magical armors will now count against wearing multiple 
          protection items.
        * Conlan will now spawn correctly in ToB games. 
        * Items which provide an addition +2d6 damage against certain 
          alignments now do the correct damage instead of the previous +1d6+6. 
        * Weapon descriptions were cleaned up; specifically they now list 
          weapon speed and conform better to the existing weapon descriptions
        * Conlan's dialogue was translated, but was always being compiled in 
          English due to an old dialogue file
        * The two darts that cast spells on their targets were causing a 
          second, unnecessary projectile to move from the wielder to the target
        * After some Discord feedback, tried to take up Wes' to-do of price 
          adjustment. This has been extrernalized to a separate library so 
          players can tweak these values to their own specs by some slight 
          modification to the tp2 and library.
